==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES						*new-8*

First an overview of the more interesting new features.  A comprehensive list
is below.


Asynchronous I/O support, channels ~

Vim can now exchange messages with other processes in the background.  This
makes it possible to have servers do work and send back the results to Vim.
See |channel-demo| for an example, this shows communicating with a Python
server.

Closely related to channels is JSON support.  JSON is widely supported and can
easily be used for inter-process communication, allowing for writing a server
in any language.  The functions to use are |json_encode()| and |json_decode()|.

This makes it possible to build very complex plugins, written in any language
and running in a separate process.


Jobs ~

Vim can now start a job, communicate with it and stop it.  This is very useful
to run a process for completion, syntax checking, etc.  Channels are used to
communicate with the job.  Jobs can also read from or write to a buffer or a
file.  See |job_start()|.


Timers ~

Also asynchronous are timers.  They can fire once or repeatedly and invoke a
function to do any work.  For example: >
	let tempTimer = timer_start(4000, 'CheckTemp')
This will call the CheckTemp() function four seconds (4000 milli seconds)
later.  See |timer_start()|.


Partials ~

Vim already had a Funcref, a reference to a function.  A partial also refers
to a function, and additionally binds arguments and/or a dictionary.  This is
especially useful for callbacks on channels and timers.  E.g., for the timer
example above, to pass an argument to the function: >
	let tempTimer = timer_start(4000, function('CheckTemp', ['out']))
This will call CheckTemp('out') four seconds later.


Lambda and Closure ~

A short way to create a function has been added: {args -> expr}.  See |lambda|.
This is useful for functions such as `filter()` and `map()`, which now also
accept a function argument.  Example: >
	:call filter(mylist, {idx, val -> val > 20})

A lambda can use variables defined in the scope where the lambda is defined.
This is usually called a |closure|.

User defined functions can also be a closure by adding the "closure" argument
|:func-closure|.


Packages ~

Plugins keep growing and more of them are available than ever before.  To keep
the collection of plugins manageable package support has been added.  This is
a convenient way to get one or more plugins, drop them in a directory and
possibly keep them updated.  Vim will load them automatically, or only when
desired.  See |packages|.


New style tests ~

This is for Vim developers.  So far writing tests for Vim has not been easy.
Vim 8 adds assert functions and a framework to run tests.  This makes it a lot
simpler to write tests and keep them updated.  Also new are several functions
that are added specifically for testing. See |test-functions|.


Window IDs ~

Previously windows could only be accessed by their number. And every time a
window would open, close or move that number changes.  Each window now has a
unique ID, so that they are easy to find.  See |win_getid()| and |win_id2win()|.


Viminfo uses timestamps ~

Previously the information stored in viminfo was whatever the last Vim wrote
there.  Now timestamps are used to always keep the most recent items.
See |viminfo-timestamp|.


Wrapping lines with indent ~

The 'breakindent' option has been added to be able to wrap lines without
changing the amount of indent.


Windows: DirectX support ~

This adds the 'renderoptions' option to allow for switching on DirectX
(DirectWrite) support on MS-Windows.


GTK+ 3 support ~

The GTK+ 3 GUI works just like GTK+ 2 except for hardly noticeable technical
differences between them.  Configure still chooses GTK+ 2 if both 2 and 3 are
available.  See src/Makefile for how to use GTK+ 3 instead.  See
|gui-x11-compiling| for other details.


Vim script enhancements					*new-vim-script-8*
-----------------------

In Vim script the following types have been added:

	|Special|	|v:false|, |v:true|, |v:none| and |v:null|
	|Channel|	connection to another process for asynchronous I/O
	|Job|		process control

Many functions and commands have been added to support the new types.

On some systems the numbers used in Vim script are now 64 bit.  This can be
checked with the |+num64| feature.

Many items were added to support |new-style-testing|.

printf() now accepts any type of argument for %s.  It is converted to a string
like with string().

==============================================================================
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES				*incompatible-8*

These changes are incompatible with previous releases.  Check this list if you
run into a problem when upgrading from Vim 7.4 to 8.0.


Better defaults without a vimrc ~

When no vimrc file is found, the |defaults.vim| script is loaded to set more
useful default values for new users.  That includes setting 'nocompatible'.
Thus Vim no longer starts up in Vi compatible mode.  If you do want that,
either create a .vimrc file that does "set compatible" or start Vim with
"vim -C".


Support removed ~

The support for MS-DOS has been removed.  It hasn't been working for a while
(Vim doesn't fit in memory) and removing it cleans up the code quite a bit.

The support for Windows 16 bit (Windows 95 and older) has been removed.

The support for OS/2 has been removed.  It probably hasn't been working for a
while since nobody uses it.

The SNiFF+ support has been removed.


Minor incompatibilities: ~

Probably...

==============================================================================
IMPROVEMENTS						*improvements-8*

The existing blowfish encryption turned out to be much weaker than it was
supposed to be.  The blowfish2 method has been added to fix that.  Note that
this still isn't a state-of-the-art encryption, but good enough for most
usage.  See 'cryptmethod'.


==============================================================================
COMPILE TIME CHANGES					*compile-changes-8*

The Vim repository was moved from Google code to github, since Google code
was shut down.  It can now be found at https://github.com/vim/vim.

Functions now use ANSI-C declarations.  At least a C-89 compatible compiler is
required.

The +visual feature is now always included.

==============================================================================

Files:      src/channel.c, src/eval.c, src/structs.h

Patch 7.4.1423
Problem:    Channel test fails on MS-Windows.

Patch 7.4.1430
Problem:    When encoding JSON, turning NaN and Infinity into null without

            src/testdir/test_alot.vim

Patch 7.4.1451

            a long time.
Solution:   Add BLN_NOOPT.  Don't call buf_valid() in buf_copy_options().
            Remember the last file name used.  When going through the buffer

            line. (Ramel Eshed)
Solution:   Make it a bit better by flushing GUI output.  Don't redraw the
            cursor after updating the screen if the blink state is off.
Files:      src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/screen.c

Patch 7.4.2026

==============================================================================
VERSION 8.1				*version-8.1* *version8.1* *vim-8.1*

This section is about improvements made between version 8.0 and 8.1.

This release has hundreds of bug fixes, there is a new feature and there are
many minor improvements.


The terminal window				*new-terminal-window*
-------------------

You can now open a window which functions as a terminal.  You can use it for:
- Running a command, such as "make", while editing in other windows
- Running a shell and execute several commands
- Use the terminal debugger plugin, see |terminal-debugger|

All of this is especially useful when running Vim on a remote (ssh)
connection, when you can't easily open more terminals.

For more information see |terminal-window|.


Changed							*changed-8.1*
-------

Internal: A few C99 features are now allowed such as // comments and a
comma after the last enum entry.  See |style-compiler|.

Since patch 8.0.0029 removed support for older MS-Windows systems, only
MS-Windows XP and later are supported.


Added							*added-8.1*
-----

Various syntax, indent and other plugins were added.

Quickfix improvements (by Yegappan Lakshmanan):
	Added support for modifying any quickfix/location list in the quickfix
	stack.
	Added a unique identifier for every quickfix/location list.
	Added support for associating any Vim type as a context information to
	a quickfix/location list.
	Enhanced the getqflist(), getloclist(), setqflist() and setloclist()
	functions to get and set the various quickfix/location list attributes.
	Added the QuickFixLine highlight group to highlight the current line
	in the quickfix window.
	The quickfix buffer b:changedtick variable is incremented for every
	change to the contained quickfix list.
	Added a changedtick variable to a quickfix/location list which is
	incremented when the list is modified.
	Added support for parsing text using 'errorformat' without creating a
	new quickfix list.
	Added support for the "module" item to a quickfix entry which can be
	used for display purposes instead of a long file name.
	Added support for freeing all the lists in the quickfix/location stack.
	When opening a quickfix window using the :copen/:cwindow commands, the
	supplied split modifiers are used.

Functions:
	All the term_ functions.

Patch 8.0.0475
Problem:    Not enough testing for the client-server feature.
Solution:   Add more tests.  Add the remote_startserver() function.  Fix that
            a locally evaluated expression uses function-local variables.
Files:      src/if_xcmdsrv.c, src/evalfunc.c, src/os_mswin.c,

            invalid. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)
Files:      src/quickfix.c, src/testdir/test_quickfix.vim

Patch 8.0.0485
Problem:    Not all windows commands are tested.
Solution:   Add more tests for windows commands. (Dominique Pelle,
            closes #1575) Run test_autocmd separately, it interferes with

Solution:   Move declaration to start of block.
Files:      src/evalfunc.c, src/main.c, src/os_mswin.c

Patch 8.0.0495
Problem:    The quotestar test uses a timer instead of a timeout, thus it
            cannot be rerun like a flaky test.
Solution:   Remove the timer and add a timeout. (Kazunobu Kuriyama)
Files:      src/testdir/test_quotestar.vim

Files:      src/arabic.c, src/testdir/test_arabic.vim

Patch 8.0.0498
Problem:    Two autocmd tests are skipped on MS-Windows.
Solution:   Make the test pass on MS-Windows. Write the messages in a file
            instead of getting the output of system().
Files:      src/testdir/test_autocmd.vim

=head1 EXPORTS

podselect()

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTE: This module is considered legacy; modern Perl releases (5.18 and
higher) are going to remove Pod-Parser from core and use L<Pod-Simple>
for all things POD.>

B<podselect()> is a function which will extract specified sections of
pod documentation from an input stream. This ability is provided by the
B<Pod::Select> module which is a subclass of B<Pod::Parser>.
B<Pod::Select> provides a method named B<select()> to specify the set of
POD sections to select for processing/printing. B<podselect()> merely
creates a B<Pod::Select> object and then invokes the B<podselect()>
followed by B<parse_from_file()>.

=head1 SECTION SPECIFICATIONS

B<podselect()> and B<Pod::Select::select()> may be given one or more
"section specifications" to restrict the text processed to only the
desired set of sections and their corresponding subsections.  A section
specification is a string containing one or more Perl-style regular
expressions separated by forward slashes ("/").  If you need to use a
forward slash literally within a section title you can escape it with a
backslash ("\/").

The formal syntax of a section specification is:

=over 4

=item *

I<head1-title-regex>/I<head2-title-regex>/...

=back

Any omitted or empty regular expressions will default to ".*".
Please note that each regular expression given is implicitly
anchored by adding "^" and "$" to the beginning and end.  Also, if a
given regular expression starts with a "!" character, then the
expression is I<negated> (so C<!foo> would match anything I<except>
C<foo>).

Some example section specifications follow.

=over 4

=item *

Match the C<NAME> and C<SYNOPSIS> sections and all of their subsections:

C<NAME|SYNOPSIS>

=item *

Match only the C<Question> and C<Answer> subsections of the C<DESCRIPTION>
section:

C<DESCRIPTION/Question|Answer>

=item *

Match the C<Comments> subsection of I<all> sections:

C</Comments>

=item *

Match all subsections of C<DESCRIPTION> I<except> for C<Comments>:

C<DESCRIPTION/!Comments>

=item *

Match the C<DESCRIPTION> section but do I<not> match any of its subsections:

C<DESCRIPTION/!.+>

=item *

Match all top level sections but none of their subsections:

C</!.+>

=back 

=begin _NOT_IMPLEMENTED_

=head1 RANGE SPECIFICATIONS

B<podselect()> and B<Pod::Select::select()> may be given one or more
"range specifications" to restrict the text processed to only the
desired ranges of paragraphs in the desired set of sections. A range
specification is a string containing a single Perl-style regular
expression (a regex), or else two Perl-style regular expressions
(regexs) separated by a ".." (Perl's "range" operator is "..").
The regexs in a range specification are delimited by forward slashes
("/").  If you need to use a forward slash literally within a regex you
can escape it with a backslash ("\/").

The formal syntax of a range specification is:

=over 4

=item *

/I<start-range-regex>/[../I<end-range-regex>/]

=back

Where each the item inside square brackets (the ".." followed by the
end-range-regex) is optional. Each "range-regex" is of the form:

    =cmd-expr text-expr

Where I<cmd-expr> is intended to match the name of one or more POD
commands, and I<text-expr> is intended to match the paragraph text for
the command. If a range-regex is supposed to match a POD command, then
the first character of the regex (the one after the initial '/')
absolutely I<must> be a single '=' character; it may not be anything
else (not even a regex meta-character) if it is supposed to match
against the name of a POD command.

If no I<=cmd-expr> is given then the text-expr will be matched against
plain textblocks unless it is preceded by a space, in which case it is
matched against verbatim text-blocks. If no I<text-expr> is given then
only the command-portion of the paragraph is matched against.

Note that these two expressions are each implicitly anchored. This
means that when matching against the command-name, there will be an
implicit '^' and '$' around the given I<=cmd-expr>; and when matching
against the paragraph text there will be an implicit '\A' and '\Z'
around the given I<text-expr>.

Unlike with section-specs, the '!' character does I<not> have any special
meaning (negation or otherwise) at the beginning of a range-spec!

Some example range specifications follow.

=over 4

=item
Match all C<=for html> paragraphs:

C</=for html/>

=item
Match all paragraphs between C<=begin html> and C<=end html>
(note that this will I<not> work correctly if such sections
are nested):

C</=begin html/../=end html/>

=item
Match all paragraphs between the given C<=item> name until the end of the
current section:

C</=item mine/../=head\d/>

=item
Match all paragraphs between the given C<=item> until the next item, or
until the end of the itemized list (note that this will I<not> work as
desired if the item contains an itemized list nested within it):

C</=item mine/../=(item|back)/>

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

The following methods are provided in this module. Each one takes a
reference to the object itself as an implicit first parameter.

=cut

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## =begin _PRIVATE_
## 
## =head1 B<_init_headings()>
## 
## Initialize the current set of active section headings.
## 
## =cut

    ## Initialize current section heading titles if necessary
    unless (defined $myData{_SECTION_HEADINGS}) {
        local *section_headings = $myData{_SECTION_HEADINGS} = [];
        for (my $i = 0; $i < $MAX_HEADING_LEVEL; ++$i) {
            $section_headings[$i] = '';
        }
    }
}

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head1 B<curr_headings()>

            ($head1, $head2, $head3, ...) = $parser->curr_headings();
            $head1 = $parser->curr_headings(1);

This method returns a list of the currently active section headings and
subheadings in the document being parsed. The list of headings returned
corresponds to the most recently parsed paragraph of the input.

If an argument is given, it must correspond to the desired section
heading number, in which case only the specified section heading is
returned. If there is no current section heading at the specified
level, then C<undef> is returned.

=cut

sub curr_headings {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->_init_headings()  unless (defined $self->{_SECTION_HEADINGS});
    my @headings = @{ $self->{_SECTION_HEADINGS} };
    return (@_ > 0  and  $_[0] =~ /^\d+$/) ? $headings[$_[0] - 1] : @headings;
}

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head1 B<select()>

            $parser->select($section_spec1,$section_spec2,...);

This method is used to select the particular sections and subsections of
POD documentation that are to be printed and/or processed. The existing
set of selected sections is I<replaced> with the given set of sections.
See B<add_selection()> for adding to the current set of selected
sections.

Each of the C<$section_spec> arguments should be a section specification
as described in L<"SECTION SPECIFICATIONS">.  The section specifications
are parsed by this method and the resulting regular expressions are
stored in the invoking object.

If no C<$section_spec> arguments are given, then the existing set of
selected sections is cleared out (which means C<all> sections will be
processed).

This method should I<not> normally be overridden by subclasses.

=cut

sub select {
    my ($self, @sections) = @_;
    local *myData = $self;

### NEED TO DISCERN A SECTION-SPEC FROM A RANGE-SPEC (look for m{^/.+/$}?)

    ##---------------------------------------------------------------------

    ## string "+", then the remaining section specifications are *added*
    ## to the current set of selections; otherwise the given section
    ## specifications will *replace* the current set of selections.
    ##
    ## This should probably be fixed someday, but for the present time,
    ## it seems incredibly unlikely that "+" would ever correspond to
    ## a legitimate section heading
    ##---------------------------------------------------------------------

    local *selected_sections = $myData{_SELECTED_SECTIONS};

    ## Compile each spec
    for my $spec (@sections) {
        if ( defined($_ = _compile_section_spec($spec)) ) {
            ## Store them in our sections array

    }
}

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head1 B<add_selection()>

            $parser->add_selection($section_spec1,$section_spec2,...);

This method is used to add to the currently selected sections and
subsections of POD documentation that are to be printed and/or
processed. See <select()> for replacing the currently selected sections.

Each of the C<$section_spec> arguments should be a section specification
as described in L<"SECTION SPECIFICATIONS">. The section specifications
are parsed by this method and the resulting regular expressions are
stored in the invoking object.

This method should I<not> normally be overridden by subclasses.

=cut

sub add_selection {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->select('+', @_);
}

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head1 B<clear_selections()>

            $parser->clear_selections();

This method takes no arguments, it has the exact same effect as invoking
<select()> with no arguments.

=cut

sub clear_selections {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->select();
}

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head1 B<match_section()>

            $boolean = $parser->match_section($heading1,$heading2,...);

Returns a value of true if the given section and subsection heading
titles match any of the currently selected section specifications in
effect from prior calls to B<select()> and B<add_selection()> (or if
there are no explicitly selected/deselected sections).

The arguments C<$heading1>, C<$heading2>, etc. are the heading titles of
the corresponding sections, subsections, etc. to try and match.  If
C<$headingN> is omitted then it defaults to the current corresponding
section heading title in the input.

This method should I<not> normally be overridden by subclasses.

=cut

    my $self = shift;

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head1 B<is_selected()>

            $boolean = $parser->is_selected($paragraph);

This method is used to determine if the block of text given in
C<$paragraph> falls within the currently selected set of POD sections
and subsections to be printed or processed. This method is also
responsible for keeping track of the current input section and
subsections. It is assumed that C<$paragraph> is the most recently read
(but not yet processed) input paragraph.

The value returned will be true if the C<$paragraph> and the rest of the
text in the same section as C<$paragraph> should be selected (included)
for processing; otherwise a false value is returned.

    my ($self, $paragraph) = @_;

=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

The following functions are exported by this module. Please note that
these are functions (not methods) and therefore C<do not> take an
implicit first argument.

=cut

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head1 B<podselect()>

            podselect(\%options,@filelist);

B<podselect> will print the raw (untranslated) POD paragraphs of all
POD sections in the given input files specified by C<@filelist>
according to the options given in C<\%options>.

If any argument to B<podselect> is a reference to a hash
(associative array) then the values with the following keys are
processed as follows:

=over 4

=item B<-output>

A string corresponding to the desired output file (or ">&STDOUT"
or ">&STDERR"), or a filehandle to write on. The default is to use
standard output.

=item B<-sections>

A reference to an array of sections specifications (as described in
L<"SECTION SPECIFICATIONS">) which indicate the desired set of POD
sections and subsections to be selected from input. If no section
specifications are given, then all sections of the PODs are used.

=begin _NOT_IMPLEMENTED_

=item B<-ranges>

A reference to an array of range specifications (as described in
L<"RANGE SPECIFICATIONS">) which indicate the desired range of POD
paragraphs to be selected from the desired input sections. If no range
specifications are given, then all paragraphs of the desired sections
are used.

=end _NOT_IMPLEMENTED_

=back

All other arguments are optional and should correspond to filehandles to
read from or the names of input files containing POD sections. A file name
of "", "-" or "<&STDIN" will be interpreted to mean standard input (which
is the default if no arguments are given).

=head1 PRIVATE METHODS AND DATA

B<Pod::Select> makes uses a number of internal methods and data fields
which clients should not need to see or use. For the sake of avoiding
name collisions with client data and methods, these methods and fields
are briefly discussed here. Determined hackers may obtain further
information about them by reading the B<Pod::Select> source code.

Private data fields are stored in the hash-object whose reference is
returned by the B<new()> constructor for this class. The names of all
private methods and data-fields used by B<Pod::Select> begin with a
prefix of "_" and match the regular expression C</^_\w+$/>.

=cut

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------

=begin _PRIVATE_

=head1 B<_compile_section_spec()>

            $listref = $parser->_compile_section_spec($section_spec);

This function (note it is a function and I<not> a method) takes a
section specification (as described in L<"SECTION SPECIFICATIONS">)
given in C<$section_sepc>, and compiles it into a list of regular
expressions. If C<$section_spec> has no syntax errors, then a reference
to the list (array) of corresponding regular expressions is returned;
otherwise C<undef> is returned and an error message is printed (using
B<carp>) for each invalid regex.

A reference to an array of references to arrays. Each subarray is a list
of anchored regular expressions (preceded by a "!" if the expression is to

"""Helper class to quickly write a loop over all standard input files.

Typical use is:

    import fileinput
    for line in fileinput.input():
        process(line)

This iterates over the lines of all files listed in sys.argv[1:],
defaulting to sys.stdin if the list is empty.  If a filename is '-' it
is also replaced by sys.stdin.  To specify an alternative list of
filenames, pass it as the argument to input().  A single file name is
also allowed.

Functions filename(), lineno() return the filename and cumulative line
number of the line that has just been read; filelineno() returns its
line number in the current file; isfirstline() returns true iff the
line just read is the first line of its file; isstdin() returns true
iff the line was read from sys.stdin.  Function nextfile() closes the
current file so that the next iteration will read the first line from
the next file (if any); lines not read from the file will not count
towards the cumulative line count; the filename is not changed until
after the first line of the next file has been read.  Function close()
closes the sequence.

Before any lines have been read, filename() returns None and both line
numbers are zero; nextfile() has no effect.  After all lines have been
read, filename() and the line number functions return the values
pertaining to the last line read; nextfile() has no effect.

All files are opened in text mode by default, you can override this by
setting the mode parameter to input() or FileInput.__init__().
If an I/O error occurs during opening or reading a file, the OSError
exception is raised.

If sys.stdin is used more than once, the second and further use will
return no lines, except perhaps for interactive use, or if it has been
explicitly reset (e.g. using sys.stdin.seek(0)).

Empty files are opened and immediately closed; the only time their
presence in the list of filenames is noticeable at all is when the
last file opened is empty.

It is possible that the last line of a file doesn't end in a newline
character; otherwise lines are returned including the trailing
newline.

Class FileInput is the implementation; its methods filename(),
lineno(), fileline(), isfirstline(), isstdin(), nextfile() and close()
correspond to the functions in the module.  In addition it has a
readline() method which returns the next input line, and a
__getitem__() method which implements the sequence behavior.  The
sequence must be accessed in strictly sequential order; sequence
access and readline() cannot be mixed.

Optional in-place filtering: if the keyword argument inplace=1 is
passed to input() or to the FileInput constructor, the file is moved
to a backup file and standard output is directed to the input file.
This makes it possible to write a filter that rewrites its input file
in place.  If the keyword argument backup=".<some extension>" is also
given, it specifies the extension for the backup file, and the backup
file remains around; by default, the extension is ".bak" and it is
deleted when the output file is closed.  In-place filtering is
disabled when standard input is read.  XXX The current implementation
does not work for MS-DOS 8+3 filesystems.

XXX Possible additions:

- optional getopt argument processing
- isatty()
- read(), read(size), even readlines()

/**
 * EVIOCGMASK - Retrieve current event mask
 *
 * This ioctl allows user to retrieve the current event mask for specific
 * event type. The argument must be of type "struct input_mask" and
 * specifies the event type to query, the address of the receive buffer and
 * the size of the receive buffer.
 *
 * The event mask is a per-client mask that specifies which events are
 * forwarded to the client. Each event code is represented by a single bit
 * in the event mask. If the bit is set, the event is passed to the client
 * normally. Otherwise, the event is filtered and will never be queued on
 * the client's receive buffer.
 *
 * Event masks do not affect global state of the input device. They only
 * affect the file descriptor they are applied to.
 *
 * The default event mask for a client has all bits set, i.e. all events
 * are forwarded to the client. If the kernel is queried for an unknown
 * event type or if the receive buffer is larger than the number of
 * event codes known to the kernel, the kernel returns all zeroes for those
 * codes.
 *
 * At maximum, codes_size bytes are copied.
 *
 * This ioctl may fail with ENODEV in case the file is revoked, EFAULT
 * if the receive-buffer points to invalid memory, or EINVAL if the kernel
 * does not implement the ioctl.

 * argument-type.
 *
 * This ioctl provides full forward compatibility. If the passed event type
 * is unknown to the kernel, or if the number of event codes specified in
 * the mask is bigger than what is known to the kernel, the ioctl is still
 * accepted and applied. However, any unknown codes are left untouched and
 * stay cleared. That means, the kernel always filters unknown codes
 * regardless of what the client requests.  If the new mask doesn't cover
 * all known event-codes, all remaining codes are automatically cleared and
 * thus filtered.

"""Configuration file parser.

A configuration file consists of sections, lead by a "[section]" header,
and followed by "name: value" entries, with continuations and such in
the style of RFC 822.

Intrinsic defaults can be specified by passing them into the
ConfigParser constructor as a dictionary.

class:

ConfigParser -- responsible for parsing a list of
                    configuration files, and managing the parsed database.

    methods:

    __init__(defaults=None, dict_type=_default_dict, allow_no_value=False,
             delimiters=('=', ':'), comment_prefixes=('#', ';'),
             inline_comment_prefixes=None, strict=True,
             empty_lines_in_values=True, default_section='DEFAULT',
             interpolation=<unset>, converters=<unset>):
        Create the parser. When `defaults' is given, it is initialized into the
        dictionary or intrinsic defaults. The keys must be strings, the values
        must be appropriate for %()s string interpolation.

        When `dict_type' is given, it will be used to create the dictionary
        objects for the list of sections, for the options within a section, and
        for the default values.

        When `delimiters' is given, it will be used as the set of substrings
        that divide keys from values.

        When `comment_prefixes' is given, it will be used as the set of
        substrings that prefix comments in empty lines. Comments can be
        indented.

        When `inline_comment_prefixes' is given, it will be used as the set of
        substrings that prefix comments in non-empty lines.

        When `strict` is True, the parser won't allow for any section or option
        duplicates while reading from a single source (file, string or
        dictionary). Default is True.

        When `empty_lines_in_values' is False (default: True), each empty line
        marks the end of an option. Otherwise, internal empty lines of
        a multiline option are kept as part of the value.

        When `allow_no_value' is True (default: False), options without
        values are accepted; the value presented for these is None.

        When `default_section' is given, the name of the special section is
        named accordingly. By default it is called ``"DEFAULT"`` but this can
        be customized to point to any other valid section name. Its current
        value can be retrieved using the ``parser_instance.default_section``
        attribute and may be modified at runtime.

        When `interpolation` is given, it should be an Interpolation subclass
        instance. It will be used as the handler for option value
        pre-processing when using getters. RawConfigParser object s don't do
        any sort of interpolation, whereas ConfigParser uses an instance of
        BasicInterpolation. The library also provides a ``zc.buildbot``
        inspired ExtendedInterpolation implementation.

        When `converters` is given, it should be a dictionary where each key
        represents the name of a type converter and each value is a callable
        implementing the conversion from string to the desired datatype. Every
        converter gets its corresponding get*() method on the parser object and
        section proxies.

    sections()
        Return all the configuration section names, sans DEFAULT.

    has_section(section)
        Return whether the given section exists.

    has_option(section, option)
        Return whether the given option exists in the given section.

    options(section)
        Return list of configuration options for the named section.

    read(filenames, encoding=None)
        Read and parse the iterable of named configuration files, given by
        name.  A single filename is also allowed.  Non-existing files
        are ignored.  Return list of successfully read files.

    read_file(f, filename=None)
        Read and parse one configuration file, given as a file object.
        The filename defaults to f.name; it is only used in error
        messages (if f has no `name' attribute, the string `<???>' is used).

    read_string(string)
        Read configuration from a given string.

    read_dict(dictionary)
        Read configuration from a dictionary. Keys are section names,
        values are dictionaries with keys and values that should be present
        in the section. If the used dictionary type preserves order, sections
        and their keys will be added in order. Values are automatically
        converted to strings.

    get(section, option, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Return a string value for the named option.  All % interpolations are
        expanded in the return values, based on the defaults passed into the
        constructor and the DEFAULT section.  Additional substitutions may be
        provided using the `vars' argument, which must be a dictionary whose
        contents override any pre-existing defaults. If `option' is a key in
        `vars', the value from `vars' is used.

    getint(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to an integer.

    getfloat(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to a float.

    getboolean(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to a boolean (currently case
        insensitively defined as 0, false, no, off for False, and 1, true,
        yes, on for True).  Returns False or True.

    items(section=_UNSET, raw=False, vars=None)
        If section is given, return a list of tuples with (name, value) for
        each option in the section. Otherwise, return a list of tuples with
        (section_name, section_proxy) for each section, including DEFAULTSECT.

    remove_section(section)
        Remove the given file section and all its options.

    remove_option(section, option)
        Remove the given option from the given section.

    set(section, option, value)
        Set the given option.

    write(fp, space_around_delimiters=True)
        Write the configuration state in .ini format. If
        `space_around_delimiters' is True (the default), delimiters
        between keys and values are surrounded by spaces.

 Usage:
	grubinst  [OPTIONS]  DEVICE_OR_FILE

OPTIONS:

	--help,-h		Show usage information

	--pause			Pause before exiting

	--version		Show version information

	--verbose,-v		Verbose output

	--list-part,-l		List all logical partitions in DEVICE_OR_FILE

	--save=FN,-s=FN		Save the orginal MBR/BS to FN

	--restore=FN,-r=FN	Restore MBR/BS from previously saved FN

	--restore-prevmbr,-r	Restore previous MBR saved in the second sector
				of DEVICE_OR_FILE

	--read-only,-t		do everything except the actual write to the
				specified DEVICE_OR_FILE. (test mode)

	--no-backup-mbr		do not copy the old MBR to the second sector of
				DEVICE_OR_FILE.

	--force-backup-mbr	force the copy of old MBR to the second sector
				of DEVICE_OR_FILE.(default)

	--mbr-enable-floppy	enable the search for GRLDR on floppy.(default)

	--mbr-disable-floppy	disable the search for GRLDR on floppy.

	--mbr-enable-osbr	enable the boot of PREVIOUS MBR with invalid
				partition table (usually an OS boot sector).
				(default)

	--mbr-disable-osbr	disable the boot of PREVIOUS MBR with invalid
				partition table (usually an OS boot sector).

	--duce			disable the feature of unconditional entrance
				to the command-line.

	--boot-prevmbr-first	try to boot PREVIOUS MBR before the search for
				GRLDR.

	--boot-prevmbr-last	try to boot PREVIOUS MBR after the search for
				GRLDR.(default)

	--preferred-drive=D	preferred boot drive number, 0 <= D < 255.

	--preferred-partition=P	preferred partition number, 0 <= P < 255.

	--time-out=T,-t=T	wait T seconds before booting PREVIOUS MBR. if
				T is 0xff, wait forever. The default is 5.

				before booting PREVIOUS MBR. K is a word
				value, just as the value in AX register
				returned from int16/AH=1. The high byte is the
				scan code and the low byte is ASCII code. The
				default is 0x3920 for space bar.

	--key-name=S		Specify the name of the hot key.

	--floppy,-f		if DEVICE_OR_FILE is floppy, use this option.

	--floppy=N		if DEVICE_OR_FILE is a partition on a hard
				drive, use this option. N is used to specify
				the partition number: 0,1,2 and 3 for the
				primary partitions, and 4,5,6,... for the
				logical partitions.

	--sectors-per-track=S	specifies sectors per track for --floppy.
				1 <= S <= 63, default is 63.

	--heads=H		specifies number of heads for --floppy.
				1 <= H <= 256, default is 255.

	--start-sector=B	specifies hidden sectors for --floppy=N.

	--total-sectors=C	specifies total sectors for --floppy.
				default is 0.

	--lba			use lba mode for --floppy. If the floppy BIOS
				has LBA support, you can specify --lba here.
				It is assumed that all floppy BIOSes have CHS
				support. So you would rather specify --chs.
				If neither --chs nor --lba is specified, then
				the LBA indicator(i.e., the third byte of the
				boot sector) will not be touched.

	--chs			use chs mode for --floppy. You should specify
				--chs if the floppy BIOS does not support LBA.
				We assume all floppy BIOSes have CHS support.
				So it is likely you want to specify --chs.
				If neither --chs nor --lba is specified, then
				the LBA indicator(i.e., the third byte of the
				boot sector) will not be touched.

	--install-partition=I	Install the boot record onto the boot area of
	-p=I			partition number I of the specified hard drive
				or harddrive image DEVICE_OR_FILE.

	--boot-file=F,-b=F	Change the name of boot file.

	--load-seg=S		Change load segment for boot file.

	--grub2,-2		Load grub2 kernel g2ldr instead of grldr.

# This file is part of systemd.
#
# Database for joystick device information that cannot be queried directly.
#
# The lookup keys are composed in:
#   70-joystick.rules
#
# Note: The format of the "joystick:" prefix match key is a
# contract between the rules file and the hardware data, it might
# change in later revisions to support more or better matches, it
# is not necessarily expected to be a stable ABI.
#
# Match string format:
# joystick:<bustype>:v<vid>p<pid>:name:<name>:
#
# vid/pid as 4-digit hex lowercase vendor/product
#
# To add local entries, create a new file
#   /etc/udev/hwdb.d/71-joystick-local.hwdb
# and add your rules there. To load the new rules execute (as root):
#   systemd-hwdb update
#   udevadm trigger /dev/input/eventXX
# where /dev/input/eventXX is the joystick in question. If in
# doubt, simply use /dev/input/event* to reload all input rules.
#
# If your changes are generally applicable, preferably send them as a pull
# request to
#   https://github.com/systemd/systemd
# or create a bug report on https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues and
# include your new rules, a description of the device, and the output of
#   udevadm info /dev/input/eventXX.
#
# Permitted keys:
#   Specify if a joystick is a built-in one or external:
#   ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK_INTEGRATION=internal|external
#
#   If the property is missing, user-space can assume:
#   ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK_INTEGRATION=external

Normally, the script presents the information in a human readable
tabular format, but that may be harder for a machine to parse. With
this option, the output is a compact, colon separated line, with no
dividers, headers, or footer.

Set the state directory to C</path/to/dir> instead of the default
C</var/lib/ucf>.  Used mostly for testing.

=head1 DESCRIPTION


This script takes a set of arguments, each of which is a package or a
path to a configuration file, and outputs the associated package, if
any, if the file exists on disk, and whether it has been modfied by te
user.  The output is either a human readable tabular form, or a
compact colon-separated machine friendly format.

This script can potentially be used in package C<postinst> scripts
during purge to query the system for configuration files that may
still exist on the system, and whether these files have been locally
modified by the user -- assuming that the package registered all the
configuration files with B<ucf> using C<ucfr>.

=head1 INTERNALS

=head2 Class Methods

All class methods mediate access to class variables.  All class
methods can be invoked with zero or one parameters. When invoked with
the optional parameter, the class method sets the value of the
underlying class data.  In either case, the value of the underlying
variable is returned.

=cut

=head1 Class ucf

This is a combination view and controller class that mediates between
the user and the internal model classes.


=head2 new

This is the constructor for the class. It takes a number of optional
parameters. If the parameter B<Colons> is present, then the output
will be compact. The parameters B<DEBUG> and B<VERBOSE> turn on
additional diagnostics from the script.

=cut

  my $class = ref($this) || $this;
  my $self = {};

  bless $self => $class;

  # validate and sanitize the settings
  $self->validate(%params);

=head2 validate

This routine is responsible for ensuring that the parameters passed in
(presumably from the command line) are given preference.

=cut

  # line on in the configuration file, if any, we use the built in
  # defaults.

=head2 process

This routine is the work horse routine -- it parses the command line
arguments, and queries the on disk databases, determines of the files
exist, and have been modified.

=head2 report

This routine generates a nicely formatted report based on the
information gathered during the processing. There are two kinds of
reports, the first being a user friendly tabular form, the second
(turned on by the C<-w> option) a easily parseable colon separated
report.
