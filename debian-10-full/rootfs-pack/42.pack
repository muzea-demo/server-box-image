# Workers are created as daemon threads. This is done to allow the interpreter
# to exit when there are still idle threads in a ThreadPoolExecutor's thread
# pool (i.e. shutdown() was not called). However, allowing workers to die with
# the interpreter has two undesirable properties:
#   - The workers would still be running during interpreter shutdown,
#     meaning that they would fail in unpredictable ways.
#   - The workers could be killed while evaluating a work item, which could
#     be bad if the callable being evaluated has external side-effects e.g.
#     writing to a file.
#
# To work around this problem, an exit handler is installed which tells the
# workers to exit when their work queues are empty and then waits until the
# threads finish.

 /etc/deluser.conf 773fb95e98a27947de4a95abb3d3f2a2
Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: GNU Bourne Again SHell
 Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes
 commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also
 incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).
 .
 Bash is ultimately intended to be a conformant implementation of the
 IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).
 .
 The Programmable Completion Code, by Ian Macdonald, is now found in
 the bash-completion package.

 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma

Description: Vera font family derivate with additional characters
 DejaVu provides an expanded version of the Vera font family aiming for
 quality and broader Unicode coverage while retaining the original Vera
 style. DejaVu currently works towards conformance with the Multilingual
 European Standards (MES-1 and MES-2) for Unicode coverage. The DejaVu
 fonts provide serif, sans and monospaced variants.
 .
 This package only contains the sans, sans-bold, serif, serif-bold,
 mono and mono-bold variants. For additional variants, see the
 ttf-dejavu-extra package.
 .
 DejaVu fonts are intended for use on low-resolution devices (mainly
 computer screens) but can be used in printing as well.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
  - VESA-based graphical mode with background image support and complete 24-bit
    color set.
  - Support for extended charsets.  Users can write UTF-8 text to their menu
    entries.
 .
 This is a dependency package for a version of GRUB that has been built for

 Argon2i and Argon2d are parametrized by:
  * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
    therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
  * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
  * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads
 .
 This package includes the dynamic library against which programs are linked.

 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, data compressor.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

    The libcroco parser implements the CSS Level 2 specification, the CSS
    forward compatibility rules and the CSS cascading rules.
 .
  * A CSS2 selection engine
    Given an xml element node (that obviously comes from an xml document) and
    a stylesheet cascade, the Libcroco selection engine can evaluate the css
    selectors of the cascade and return the style properties associated to
    the xml element node.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Description: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: low level cryptographic library (public-key cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

Source: libpthread-stubs
Version: 0.4-1
Description: pthread stubs not provided by native libc, development files
 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided
 in libc or otherwise available by default.  Libraries like libxcb rely
 on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when
 linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
 single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
 platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.
 .
 On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
 package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
 libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
 still obtain correct behavior.

 The primary goal of this project is to define a portable and efficient C
 programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a program.
 The API additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved
 (callee-saved) state of each call-frame and to resume execution at any
 point in the call-chain (non-local goto). The API supports both local
 (same-process) and remote (across-process) operation. As such, the API
 is useful in a number of applications.

 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: X cursor management library
 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
 X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.
 .
 Preferred themes for cursors can be installed if desired, via
 xcursor-themes or other cursor-theme or icon-theme packages,
 configured with update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme.

 Rendering geometric figures is accomplished by client-side tessellation into
 either triangles or trapezoids.  Text is drawn by loading glyphs into the
 server and rendering sets of them.  The Xrender library exposes this
 extension to X clients.

 GNU Make is a utility which controls the generation of executables
 and other target files of a program from the program's source
 files. It determines automatically which pieces of a large program
 need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
 them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
 are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
 corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
 computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency
 solver.

Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

Description: Core Perl modules
 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.
 .
 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules-5.28' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules-5.28') instead.

Description: System call tracer
 strace is a system call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
 a trace of all the system calls made by a another process/program.
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have source.
 .
 System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive
 parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting
 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
 elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

*matchit* *matchit.vim*

1. Extended matching with "%"				|matchit-intro|
2. Activation						|matchit-activate|
3. Configuration					|matchit-configure|
4. Supporting a New Language				|matchit-newlang|
5. Known Bugs and Limitations				|matchit-bugs|

The functionality mentioned here is a plugin, see |add-plugin|.
This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

{Vi does not have any of this}

==============================================================================
1. Extended matching with "%"				*matchit-intro*

							*matchit-%*
%	Cycle forward through matching groups, such as "if", "else", "endif",
	as specified by |b:match_words|.

							*g%* *v_g%* *o_g%*
g%	Cycle backwards through matching groups, as specified by
	|b:match_words|.  For example, go from "if" to "endif" to "else".

							*[%* *v_[%* *o_[%*
[%	Go to [count] previous unmatched group, as specified by
	|b:match_words|.  Similar to |[{|.

							*]%* *v_]%* *o_]%*
]%	Go to [count] next unmatched group, as specified by
	|b:match_words|.  Similar to |]}|.

							*v_a%*
a%	In Visual mode, select the matching group, as specified by
	|b:match_words|, containing the cursor.  Similar to |v_a[|.
	A [count] is ignored, and only the first character of the closing
	pattern is selected.

In Vim, as in plain vi, the percent key, |%|, jumps the cursor from a brace,
bracket, or paren to its match.  This can be configured with the 'matchpairs'
option.  The matchit plugin extends this in several ways:

	    You can match whole words, such as "if" and "endif", not just
	single characters.  You can also specify a |regular-expression|.
	    You can define groups with more than two words, such as "if",
	"else", "endif".  Banging on the "%" key will cycle from the "if" to
	the first "else", the next "else", ..., the closing "endif", and back
	to the opening "if".  Nested structures are skipped.  Using |g%| goes
	in the reverse direction.
	    By default, words inside comments and strings are ignored, unless
	the cursor is inside a comment or string when you type "%".  If the
	only thing you want to do is modify the behavior of "%" so that it
	behaves this way, you do not have to define |b:match_words|, since the
	script uses the 'matchpairs' option as well as this variable.

See |matchit-details| for details on what the script does, and |b:match_words|
for how to specify matching patterns.

MODES:			*matchit-modes* *matchit-v_%* *matchit-o_%*

Mostly, % and related motions (|g%| and |[%| and |]%|) should just work like built-in
|motion| commands in |Operator-pending| and |Visual| modes (as of 8.1.648)

LANGUAGES:					*matchit-languages*

Currently, the following languages are supported:  Ada, ASP with VBS, Csh,
DTD, Entity, Essbase, Fortran, HTML, JSP (same as HTML), LaTeX, Lua, Pascal,
SGML, Shell, Tcsh, Vim, XML.  Other languages may already have support via
the default |filetype-plugin|s in the standard vim distribution.

To support a new language, see |matchit-newlang| below.

DETAILS:				*matchit-details* *matchit-parse*

Here is an outline of what matchit.vim does each time you hit the "%" key.  If
there are |backref|s in |b:match_words| then the first step is to produce a
version in which these back references have been eliminated; if there are no
|backref|s then this step is skipped.  This step is called parsing.  For
example, "\(foo\|bar\):end\1" is parsed to yield
"\(foo\|bar\):end\(foo\|bar\)".  This can get tricky, especially if there are
nested groups.  If debugging is turned on, the parsed version is saved as
|b:match_pat|.

							*matchit-choose*
Next, the script looks for a word on the current line that matches the pattern
just constructed.  It includes the patterns from the 'matchpairs' option.
The goal is to do what you expect, which turns out to be a little complicated.
The script follows these rules:

	Insist on a match that ends on or after the cursor.
	Prefer a match that includes the cursor position (that is, one that
		starts on or before the cursor).
	Prefer a match that starts as close to the cursor as possible.
	If more than one pattern in |b:match_words| matches, choose the one
		that is listed first.

Examples:

	Suppose you >
		:let b:match_words = '<:>,<tag>:</tag>'
<	and hit "%" with the cursor on or before the "<" in "a <tag> is born".
	The pattern '<' comes first, so it is preferred over '<tag>', which
	also matches.  If the cursor is on the "t", however, then '<tag>' is
	preferred, because this matches a bit of text containing the cursor.
	If the two groups of patterns were reversed then '<' would never be
	preferred.

	Suppose you >
		:let b:match_words = 'if:end if'
<	(Note the space!) and hit "%" with the cursor at the end of "end if".
	Then "if" matches, which is probably not what you want, but if the
	cursor starts on the "end " then "end if" is chosen.  (You can avoid
	this problem by using a more complicated pattern.)

If there is no match, the cursor does not move.  (Before version 1.13 of the
script, it would fall back on the usual behavior of |%|).  If debugging is
turned on, the matched bit of text is saved as |b:match_match| and the cursor
column of the start of the match is saved as |b:match_col|.

Next, the script looks through |b:match_words| (original and parsed versions)
for the group and pattern that match.  If debugging is turned on, the group is
saved as |b:match_ini| (the first pattern) and |b:match_tail| (the rest).  If
there are |backref|s then, in addition, the matching pattern is saved as
|b:match_word| and a table of translations is saved as |b:match_table|.  If
there are |backref|s, these are determined from the matching pattern and
|b:match_match| and substituted into each pattern in the matching group.

The script decides whether to search forwards or backwards and chooses
arguments for the |searchpair()| function.  Then, the cursor is moved to the
start of the match, and |searchpair()| is called.  By default, matching
structures inside strings and comments are ignored.  This can be changed by
setting |b:match_skip|.

==============================================================================
2. Activation						*matchit-activate*

To use the matchit plugin add this line to your |vimrc|: >
	packadd! matchit

The script should start working the next time you start Vim.

(Earlier versions of the script did nothing unless a |buffer-variable| named
|b:match_words| was defined.  Even earlier versions contained autocommands
that set this variable for various file types.  Now, |b:match_words| is
defined in many of the default |filetype-plugin|s instead.)

For a new language, you can add autocommands to the script or to your vimrc
file, but the recommended method is to add a line such as >
	let b:match_words = '\<foo\>:\<bar\>'
to the |filetype-plugin| for your language.  See |b:match_words| below for how
this variable is interpreted.

TROUBLESHOOTING					*matchit-troubleshoot*

The script should work in most installations of Vim.  It may not work if Vim
was compiled with a minimal feature set, for example if the |+syntax| option
was not enabled.  If your Vim has support for syntax compiled in, but you do
not have |syntax| highlighting turned on, matchit.vim should work, but it may
fail to skip matching groups in comments and strings.  If the |filetype|
mechanism is turned off, the |b:match_words| variable will probably not be
defined automatically.

==============================================================================
3. Configuration					*matchit-configure*

There are several variables that govern the behavior of matchit.vim.  Note
that these are variables local to the buffer, not options, so use |:let| to
define them, not |:set|.  Some of these variables have values that matter; for
others, it only matters whether the variable has been defined.  All of these
can be defined in the |filetype-plugin| or autocommand that defines
|b:match_words| or "on the fly."

The main variable is |b:match_words|.  It is described in the section below on
supporting a new language.

				*MatchError* *matchit-hl* *matchit-highlight*
MatchError is the highlight group for error messages from the script.  By
default, it is linked to WarningMsg.  If you do not want to be bothered by
error messages, you can define this to be something invisible.  For example,
if you use the GUI version of Vim and your command line is normally white, you
can do >
	:hi MatchError guifg=white guibg=white
<
						*b:match_ignorecase*
If you >
	:let b:match_ignorecase = 1
then matchit.vim acts as if 'ignorecase' is set: for example, "end" and "END"
are equivalent.  If you >
	:let b:match_ignorecase = 0
then matchit.vim treats "end" and "END" differently.  (There will be no
b:match_infercase option unless someone requests it.)

						*b:match_debug*
Define b:match_debug if you want debugging information to be saved.  See
|matchit-debug|, below.

						*b:match_skip*
If b:match_skip is defined, it is passed as the skip argument to
|searchpair()|.  This controls when matching structures are skipped, or
ignored.  By default, they are ignored inside comments and strings, as
determined by the |syntax| mechanism.  (If syntax highlighting is turned off,
nothing is skipped.)  You can set b:match_skip to a string, which evaluates to
a non-zero, numerical value if the match is to be skipped or zero if the match
should not be skipped.  In addition, the following special values are
supported by matchit.vim:
	s:foo becomes (current syntax item) =~ foo
	S:foo becomes (current syntax item) !~ foo
	r:foo becomes (line before cursor) =~ foo
	R:foo becomes (line before cursor) !~ foo
(The "s" is meant to suggest "syntax", and the "r" is meant to suggest
"regular expression".)

Examples:

	You can get the default behavior with >
		:let b:match_skip = 's:comment\|string'
<
	If you want to skip matching structures unless they are at the start
	of the line (ignoring whitespace) then you can >
		:let b:match_skip = 'R:^\s*'
<	Do not do this if strings or comments can span several lines, since
	the normal syntax checking will not be done if you set b:match_skip.

	In LaTeX, since "%" is used as the comment character, you can >
		:let b:match_skip = 'r:%'
<	Unfortunately, this will skip anything after "\%", an escaped "%".  To
	allow for this, and also "\\%" (an escaped backslash followed by the
	comment character) you can >
		:let b:match_skip = 'r:\(^\|[^\\]\)\(\\\\\)*%'
<
	See the $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/vim.vim for an example that uses both
	syntax and a regular expression.

==============================================================================
4. Supporting a New Language				*matchit-newlang*
							*b:match_words*
In order for matchit.vim to support a new language, you must define a suitable
pattern for |b:match_words|.  You may also want to set some of the
|matchit-configure| variables, as described above.  If your language has a
complicated syntax, or many keywords, you will need to know something about
Vim's |regular-expression|s.

The format for |b:match_words| is similar to that of the 'matchpairs' option:
it is a comma (,)-separated list of groups; each group is a colon(:)-separated
list of patterns (regular expressions).  Commas and backslashes that are part
of a pattern should be escaped with backslashes ('\:' and '\,').  It is OK to
have only one group; the effect is undefined if a group has only one pattern.
A simple example is >
	:let b:match_words = '\<if\>:\<endif\>,'
		\ . '\<while\>:\<continue\>:\<break\>:\<endwhile\>'
(In Vim regular expressions, |\<| and |\>| denote word boundaries.  Thus "if"
matches the end of "endif" but "\<if\>" does not.)  Then banging on the "%"
key will bounce the cursor between "if" and the matching "endif"; and from
"while" to any matching "continue" or "break", then to the matching "endwhile"
and back to the "while".  It is almost always easier to use |literal-string|s
(single quotes) as above:  '\<if\>' rather than "\\<if\\>" and so on.

Exception:  If the ":" character does not appear in b:match_words, then it is
treated as an expression to be evaluated.  For example, >
	:let b:match_words = 'GetMatchWords()'
allows you to define a function.  This can return a different string depending
on the current syntax, for example.

Once you have defined the appropriate value of |b:match_words|, you will
probably want to have this set automatically each time you edit the
appropriate file type.  The recommended way to do this is by adding the
definition to a |filetype-plugin| file.

Tips: Be careful that your initial pattern does not match your final pattern.
See the example above for the use of word-boundary expressions.  It is usually
better to use ".\{-}" (as many as necessary) instead of ".*" (as many as
possible).  See |\{-|.  For example, in the string "<tag>label</tag>", "<.*>"
matches the whole string whereas "<.\{-}>" and "<[^>]*>" match "<tag>" and
"</tag>".

				*matchit-spaces* *matchit-s:notend*
If "if" is to be paired with "end if" (Note the space!) then word boundaries
are not enough.  Instead, define a regular expression s:notend that will match
anything but "end" and use it as follows: >
	:let s:notend = '\%(\<end\s\+\)\@<!'
	:let b:match_words = s:notend . '\<if\>:\<end\s\+if\>'
<							*matchit-s:sol*
This is a simplified version of what is done for Ada.  The s:notend is a
|script-variable|.  Similarly, you may want to define a start-of-line regular
expression >
	:let s:sol = '\%(^\|;\)\s*'
if keywords are only recognized after the start of a line or after a
semicolon (;), with optional white space.

					*matchit-backref* *matchit-\1*
In any group, the expressions |\1|, |\2|, ..., |\9| refer to parts of the
INITIAL pattern enclosed in |\(|escaped parentheses|\)|.  These are referred
to as back references, or backrefs.  For example, >
	:let b:match_words = '\<b\(o\+\)\>:\(h\)\1\>'
means that "bo" pairs with "ho" and "boo" pairs with "hoo" and so on.  Note
that "\1" does not refer to the "\(h\)" in this example.  If you have
"\(nested \(parentheses\)\) then "\d" refers to the d-th "\(" and everything
up to and including the matching "\)":  in "\(nested\(parentheses\)\)", "\1"
refers to everything and "\2" refers to "\(parentheses\)".  If you use a
variable such as |s:notend| or |s:sol| in the previous paragraph then remember
to count any "\(" patterns in this variable.  You do not have to count groups
defined by |\%(\)|.

It should be possible to resolve back references from any pattern in the
group.  For example, >
	:let b:match_words = '\(foo\)\(bar\):more\1:and\2:end\1\2'
would not work because "\2" cannot be determined from "morefoo" and "\1"
cannot be determined from "andbar".  On the other hand, >
	:let b:match_words = '\(\(foo\)\(bar\)\):\3\2:end\1'
should work (and have the same effect as "foobar:barfoo:endfoobar"), although
this has not been thoroughly tested.

You can use |zero-width| patterns such as |\@<=| and |\zs|.  (The latter has
not been thouroughly tested in matchit.vim.)  For example, if the keyword "if"
must occur at the start of the line, with optional white space, you might use
the pattern "\(^\s*\)\@<=if" so that the cursor will end on the "i" instead of
at the start of the line.  For another example, if HTML had only one tag then
one could >
	:let b:match_words = '<:>,<\@<=tag>:<\@<=/tag>'
so that "%" can bounce between matching "<" and ">" pairs or (starting on
"tag" or "/tag") between matching tags.  Without the |\@<=|, the script would
bounce from "tag" to the "<" in "</tag>", and another "%" would not take you
back to where you started.

DEBUGGING				*matchit-debug* *:MatchDebug*

If you are having trouble figuring out the appropriate definition of
|b:match_words| then you can take advantage of the same information I use when
debugging the script.  This is especially true if you are not sure whether
your patterns or my script are at fault!  To make this more convenient, I have
made the command :MatchDebug, which defines the variable |b:match_debug| and
creates a Matchit menu.  This menu makes it convenient to check the values of
the variables described below.  You will probably also want to read
|matchit-details| above.

Defining the variable |b:match_debug| causes the script to set the following
variables, each time you hit the "%" key.  Several of these are only defined
if |b:match_words| includes |backref|s.

							*b:match_pat*
The b:match_pat variable is set to |b:match_words| with |backref|s parsed.
							*b:match_match*
The b:match_match variable is set to the bit of text that is recognized as a
match.
							*b:match_col*
The b:match_col variable is set to the cursor column of the start of the
matching text.
							*b:match_wholeBR*
The b:match_wholeBR variable is set to the comma-separated group of patterns
that matches, with |backref|s unparsed.
							*b:match_iniBR*
The b:match_iniBR variable is set to the first pattern in |b:match_wholeBR|.
							*b:match_ini*
The b:match_ini variable is set to the first pattern in |b:match_wholeBR|,
with |backref|s resolved from |b:match_match|.
							*b:match_tail*
The b:match_tail variable is set to the remaining patterns in
|b:match_wholeBR|, with |backref|s resolved from |b:match_match|.
							*b:match_word*
The b:match_word variable is set to the pattern from |b:match_wholeBR| that
matches |b:match_match|.
							*b:match_table*
The back reference '\'.d refers to the same thing as '\'.b:match_table[d] in
|b:match_word|.

==============================================================================
5. Known Bugs and Limitations				*matchit-bugs*

Just because I know about a bug does not mean that it is on my todo list.  I
try to respond to reports of bugs that cause real problems.  If it does not
cause serious problems, or if there is a work-around, a bug may sit there for
a while.  Moral:  if a bug (known or not) bothers you, let me know.

It would be nice if "\0" were recognized as the entire pattern.  That is, it
would be nice if "foo:\end\0" had the same effect as "\(foo\):\end\1".  I may
try to implement this in a future version.  (This is not so easy to arrange as
you might think!)

=head1 NAME

File::GlobMapper - Extend File Glob to Allow Input and Output Files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::GlobMapper qw( globmap );

    my $aref = globmap $input => $output
        or die $File::GlobMapper::Error ;

    my $gm = new File::GlobMapper $input => $output
        or die $File::GlobMapper::Error ;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module needs Perl5.005 or better.

This module takes the existing C<File::Glob> module as a starting point and
extends it to allow new filenames to be derived from the files matched by
C<File::Glob>.

This can be useful when carrying out batch operations on multiple files that
have both an input filename and output filename and the output file can be
derived from the input filename. Examples of operations where this can be
useful include, file renaming, file copying and file compression.


=head2 Behind The Scenes

To help explain what C<File::GlobMapper> does, consider what code you
would write if you wanted to rename all files in the current directory
that ended in C<.tar.gz> to C<.tgz>. So say these files are in the
current directory

    alpha.tar.gz
    beta.tar.gz
    gamma.tar.gz

and they need renamed to this

    alpha.tgz
    beta.tgz
    gamma.tgz

Below is a possible implementation of a script to carry out the rename
(error cases have been omitted)

    foreach my $old ( glob "*.tar.gz" )
    {
        my $new = $old;
        $new =~ s#(.*)\.tar\.gz$#$1.tgz# ;

        rename $old => $new 
            or die "Cannot rename '$old' to '$new': $!\n;
    }

Notice that a file glob pattern C<*.tar.gz> was used to match the
C<.tar.gz> files, then a fairly similar regular expression was used in
the substitute to allow the new filename to be created.

Given that the file glob is just a cut-down regular expression and that it
has already done a lot of the hard work in pattern matching the filenames,
wouldn't it be handy to be able to use the patterns in the fileglob to
drive the new filename?

Well, that's I<exactly> what C<File::GlobMapper> does. 

Here is same snippet of code rewritten using C<globmap>

    for my $pair (globmap '<*.tar.gz>' => '<#1.tgz>' )
    {
        my ($from, $to) = @$pair;
        rename $from => $to 
            or die "Cannot rename '$old' to '$new': $!\n;
    }

So how does it work?

Behind the scenes the C<globmap> function does a combination of a
file glob to match existing filenames followed by a substitute
to create the new filenames. 

Notice how both parameters to C<globmap> are strings that are delimited by <>.
This is done to make them look more like file globs - it is just syntactic
sugar, but it can be handy when you want the strings to be visually
distinctive. The enclosing <> are optional, so you don't have to use them - in
fact the first thing globmap will do is remove these delimiters if they are
present.

The first parameter to C<globmap>, C<*.tar.gz>, is an I<Input File Glob>. 
Once the enclosing "< ... >" is removed, this is passed (more or
less) unchanged to C<File::Glob> to carry out a file match.

Next the fileglob C<*.tar.gz> is transformed behind the scenes into a
full Perl regular expression, with the additional step of wrapping each
transformed wildcard metacharacter sequence in parenthesis.

In this case the input fileglob C<*.tar.gz> will be transformed into
this Perl regular expression 

    ([^/]*)\.tar\.gz

Wrapping with parenthesis allows the wildcard parts of the Input File
Glob to be referenced by the second parameter to C<globmap>, C<#1.tgz>,
the I<Output File Glob>. This parameter operates just like the replacement
part of a substitute command. The difference is that the C<#1> syntax
is used to reference sub-patterns matched in the input fileglob, rather
than the C<$1> syntax that is used with perl regular expressions. In
this case C<#1> is used to refer to the text matched by the C<*> in the
Input File Glob. This makes it easier to use this module where the
parameters to C<globmap> are typed at the command line.

The final step involves passing each filename matched by the C<*.tar.gz>
file glob through the derived Perl regular expression in turn and
expanding the output fileglob using it.

The end result of all this is a list of pairs of filenames. By default
that is what is returned by C<globmap>. In this example the data structure
returned will look like this

     ( ['alpha.tar.gz' => 'alpha.tgz'],
       ['beta.tar.gz'  => 'beta.tgz' ],
       ['gamma.tar.gz' => 'gamma.tgz']
     )


Each pair is an array reference with two elements - namely the I<from>
filename, that C<File::Glob> has matched, and a I<to> filename that is
derived from the I<from> filename.



=head2 Limitations

C<File::GlobMapper> has been kept simple deliberately, so it isn't intended to
solve all filename mapping operations. Under the hood C<File::Glob> (or for
older versions of Perl, C<File::BSDGlob>) is used to match the files, so you
will never have the flexibility of full Perl regular expression.

=head2 Input File Glob

The syntax for an Input FileGlob is identical to C<File::Glob>, except
for the following

=over 5

=item 1.

No nested {}

=item 2.

Whitespace does not delimit fileglobs.

=item 3.

The use of parenthesis can be used to capture parts of the input filename.

=item 4.

If an Input glob matches the same file more than once, only the first
will be used.

=back

The syntax

=over 5

=item B<~>

=item B<~user>


=item B<.>

Matches a literal '.'.
Equivalent to the Perl regular expression

    \.

=item B<*>

Matches zero or more characters, except '/'. Equivalent to the Perl
regular expression

    [^/]*

=item B<?>

Matches zero or one character, except '/'. Equivalent to the Perl
regular expression

    [^/]?

=item B<\>

Backslash is used, as usual, to escape the next character.

=item  B<[]>

Character class.

=item  B<{,}>

Alternation

=item  B<()>

Capturing parenthesis that work just like perl

=back

Any other character it taken literally.

=head2 Output File Glob

The Output File Glob is a normal string, with 2 glob-like features.

The first is the '*' metacharacter. This will be replaced by the complete
filename matched by the input file glob. So

    *.c *.Z

The second is     

Output FileGlobs take the 

=over 5

=item "*"

The "*" character will be replaced with the complete input filename.

=item #1

Patterns of the form /#\d/ will be replaced with the 

=back

=head2 Returned Data


=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 A Rename script

Below is a simple "rename" script that uses C<globmap> to determine the
source and destination filenames.

    use File::GlobMapper qw(globmap) ;
    use File::Copy;

    die "rename: Usage rename 'from' 'to'\n"
        unless @ARGV == 2 ;

    my $fromGlob = shift @ARGV;
    my $toGlob   = shift @ARGV;

    my $pairs = globmap($fromGlob, $toGlob)
        or die $File::GlobMapper::Error;

    for my $pair (@$pairs)
    {
        my ($from, $to) = @$pair;
        move $from => $to ;
    }



Here is an example that renames all c files to cpp.
    
    $ rename '*.c' '#1.cpp'

=head2 A few example globmaps

Below are a few examples of globmaps

To copy all your .c file to a backup directory

    '</my/home/*.c>'    '</my/backup/#1.c>'

If you want to compress all    

    '</my/home/*.[ch]>'    '<*.gz>'

To uncompress

    '</my/home/*.[ch].gz>'    '</my/home/#1.#2>'

    of the Distutils.  A useful analogy for command classes is to think of
    them as subroutines with local variables called "options".  The options
    are "declared" in 'initialize_options()' and "defined" (given their
    final values, aka "finalized") in 'finalize_options()', both of which
    must be defined by every command class.  The distinction between the
    two is necessary because option values might come from the outside
    world (command line, config file, ...), and any options dependent on
    other options must be computed *after* these outside influences have
    been processed -- hence 'finalize_options()'.  The "body" of the
    subroutine, where it does all its work based on the values of its
    options, is the 'run()' method, which must also be implemented by every
    command class.

"""FeedParser - An email feed parser.

The feed parser implements an interface for incrementally parsing an email
message, line by line.  This has advantages for certain applications, such as
those reading email messages off a socket.

FeedParser.feed() is the primary interface for pushing new data into the
parser.  It returns when there's nothing more it can do with the available
data.  When you have no more data to push into the parser, call .close().
This completes the parsing and returns the root message object.

The other advantage of this parser is that it will never raise a parsing
exception.  Instead, when it finds something unexpected, it adds a 'defect' to
the current message.  Defects are just instances that live on the message
object's .defects attribute.

"""Python version compatibility support for minidom.

This module contains internal implementation details and
should not be imported; use xml.dom.minidom instead.
"""

# This module should only be imported using "import *".
#
# The following names are defined:
#
#   NodeList      -- lightest possible NodeList implementation
#
#   EmptyNodeList -- lightest possible NodeList that is guaranteed to
#                    remain empty (immutable)
#
#   StringTypes   -- tuple of defined string types
#
#   defproperty   -- function used in conjunction with GetattrMagic;
#                    using these together is needed to make them work
#                    as efficiently as possible in both Python 2.2+
#                    and older versions.  For example:
#
#                        class MyClass(GetattrMagic):
#                            def _get_myattr(self):
#                                return something
#
#                        defproperty(MyClass, "myattr",
#                                    "return some value")
#
#                    For Python 2.2 and newer, this will construct a
#                    property object on the class, which avoids
#                    needing to override __getattr__().  It will only
#                    work for read-only attributes.
#
#                    For older versions of Python, inheriting from
#                    GetattrMagic will use the traditional
#                    __getattr__() hackery to achieve the same effect,
#                    but less efficiently.
#
#                    defproperty() should be used for each version of
#                    the relevant _get_<property>() function.

This module defines two useful functions:

guess_type(url, strict=True) -- guess the MIME type and encoding of a URL.

guess_extension(type, strict=True) -- guess the extension for a given MIME type.

It also contains the following, for tuning the behavior:

Data:

knownfiles -- list of files to parse
inited -- flag set when init() has been called
suffix_map -- dictionary mapping suffixes to suffixes
encodings_map -- dictionary mapping suffixes to encodings
types_map -- dictionary mapping suffixes to types

Functions:

init([files]) -- parse a list of files, default knownfiles (on Windows, the
  default values are taken from the registry)
read_mime_types(file) -- parse one file, return a dictionary or None

    and supports basic determination of MIME type from a filename or
    URL, and can guess a reasonable extension given a MIME type.

        Return value is a tuple (type, encoding) where type is None if
        the type can't be guessed (no or unknown suffix) or a string
        of the form type/subtype, usable for a MIME Content-type
        header; and encoding is None for no encoding or the name of
        the program used to encode (e.g. compress or gzip).  The
        mappings are table driven.  Encoding suffixes are case
        sensitive; type suffixes are first tried case sensitive, then
        case insensitive.

        The suffixes .tgz, .taz and .tz (case sensitive!) are all
        mapped to '.tar.gz'.  (This is table-driven too, using the
        dictionary suffix_map.)

        Optional `strict' argument when False adds a bunch of commonly found,
        but non-standard types.

    Return value is a tuple (type, encoding) where type is None if the
    type can't be guessed (no or unknown suffix) or a string of the
    form type/subtype, usable for a MIME Content-type header; and
    encoding is None for no encoding or the name of the program used
    to encode (e.g. compress or gzip).  The mappings are table
    driven.  Encoding suffixes are case sensitive; type suffixes are
    first tried case sensitive, then case insensitive.

    The suffixes .tgz, .taz and .tz (case sensitive!) are all mapped
    to ".tar.gz".  (This is table-driven too, using the dictionary
    suffix_map).

    Optional `strict' argument when false adds a bunch of commonly found, but
    non-standard types.

S )r   a  Primitive lock objects.

    A primitive lock is a synchronization primitive that is not owned
    by a particular coroutine when locked.  A primitive lock is in one
    of two states, 'locked' or 'unlocked'.

    It is created in the unlocked state.  It has two basic methods,
    acquire() and release().  When the state is unlocked, acquire()
    changes the state to locked and returns immediately.  When the
    state is locked, acquire() blocks until a call to release() in
    another coroutine changes it to unlocked, then the acquire() call
    resets it to locked and returns.  The release() method should only
    be called in the locked state; it changes the state to unlocked
    and returns immediately.  If an attempt is made to release an
    unlocked lock, a RuntimeError will be raised.

    When more than one coroutine is blocked in acquire() waiting for
    the state to turn to unlocked, only one coroutine proceeds when a
    release() call resets the state to unlocked; first coroutine which
    is blocked in acquire() is being processed.

    acquire() is a coroutine and should be called with 'await'.

    Locks also support the asynchronous context management protocol.
    'async with lock' statement should be used.

    Usage:

        lock = Lock()
        ...
        await lock.acquire()
        try:
            ...
        finally:
            lock.release()

    Context manager usage:

        lock = Lock()
        ...
        async with lock:
             ...

    Lock objects can be tested for locking state:

        if not lock.locked():
           await lock.acquire()
        else:
           # lock is acquired
           ...

S )r   a  A Semaphore implementation.

    A semaphore manages an internal counter which is decremented by each
    acquire() call and incremented by each release() call. The counter
    can never go below zero; when acquire() finds that it is zero, it blocks,
    waiting until some other thread calls release().

    Semaphores also support the context management protocol.

    The optional argument gives the initial value for the internal
    counter; it defaults to 1. If the value given is less than 0,
    ValueError is raised.

   Format syntax:
  A format is a string that will be output for each package. The format
  can include the standard escape sequences \n (newline), \r (carriage
  return) or \\ (plain backslash). Package information can be included
  by inserting variable references to package fields using the ${var[;width]}
  syntax. Fields will be right-aligned unless the width is negative in which
  case left alignment will be used.

Use 'dpkg' to install and remove packages from your system, or
'apt' or 'aptitude' for user-friendly package management. Packages
unpacked using 'dpkg-deb --extract' will be incorrectly installed !
